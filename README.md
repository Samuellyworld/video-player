# video-player

just a project testing my vanilla javascript skills with video player, toggling different attributes and dom events

## Play/Pause

in the script.js there is a function written with an event to toggle this and also manipulate the play/pause icon when 'click' on. also an event 'ended' to notice when the video end
so as to toggle the play/pause function when it does.

## Progress Bar

when you press anywhere in the progress bar you will noticed the bar jumps to wherever was pressed. that is a 'click' event working on the progress bar and a 'timeupdate' event working on the 
progress range.


## Voume Icon

a click event is also being used to manipulate the  mute/unmute icon, also a video attribute called video.volume to manipulate the volume of the video. with variance in the icon using javascript 
to set the icon  dynamically.


## PlayBackRate

a change event is being triggered to change the speed of the video either from 0.5, 0.75, 1 , 1.5 or 2. notice the video default for playbackRate is 1.


## fullscreen

a click event is used on the on the fullscreen button. also i created a function to toggle the fullscreen button when it is being pressed.



All icons from font-awesome-solid.
